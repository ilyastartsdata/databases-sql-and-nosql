Task 1:

Install MySQL DBMS. Create a .my.cnf file in your home directory by specifying the login and password that was specified during installation.

Since this task is performed through the terminal, I upload its solution as a text file.

I have a MacBook, so I worked exclusively with Sequel Pro, but creating .my.cnf there is impossible because .spf was added every time I saved it. 

I did not find any way to change this. I had to install DBeaver.

I made the following entry in DBeaver itself:
	[mysql]
	user=root
	*********

Then configured the file to be available only to my user.

The next step was to check via a terminal:

	First a check to see if the file was available:
		ls -la ~ | grep .my.cnf
	Then view the content:
		cat ~/.my.cnf

It is now possible to run mysql via the terminal without entering a user or password.
