Task 3:

Create a database dump from a previous job, expand the contents of the dump into a new database.

Since this task is performed through a terminal, I upload the solution as a text file.

The first step was to change the .my.cnf file, namely to replace [mysql] with [cient].

After that I entered mysql in the terminal and created a new database via the CREATE DATABASE sample;

To ensure success, I checked the list of all databases via SHOW DATABASES;

Now to the dump itself:
	mysqldump example > dump.sql
	mysql sample < dump.sql
